    Fedorovsk is a font designed to mimic the typeface used by Ivan Fedorov, who produced some of the first printed books in Moscow in 1564. It is intended primarily for reproducing publications from the Moscow Print Yard from the late 16th to mid-17th century, either in an academic setting, or as modern Old Rite liturgical texts.

    Fedorovsk was designed by Nikita Simmons in 2007. Further edited by Aleksandr Andreev and Nikita Simmons.
